## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I want to build a website utilizing Java to demonstrate how ranked voting works, and how it might have worked as an alternative to the arguably antiquated caucus system.

The website would act first as an educational tool to show users how a ranked voting system would work using the presidential candidates the 2016 (GOP - 17 possible candidates) and 2020 (Democrats - 29 candidates)  as examples. 

### Features
Random vote generator that allows users to create a list of candidates and then create random or non-random vote tallies to display how results are calculated to eventually provide a winner with 50%+ of the votes.

Automated vote recalculation based on dropping off lowest vote-getter and recalculating the votes to the remaining candidates

Build your own candidate form will allow candidate names (required), photos (not required), candidate description (not required)


### Technologies
Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate, Thymeleaf templates

### What I'll Have to Learn
Learn some more robust functions, and utilize APIs to allow my users to share their results.
